// *foreverSquare* A sketch that displays an endless loop. Tried to incorporate a class to practice better style habits. It took a while to figure out
// the adding of a new loop but discovered redraw() function in the p5 library which solved the problem of duplicating the 
// behavior of the first square. click-to-generate-a-new-square. Spotify color scheme.


var s1;
function setup() {
	createCanvas(windowWidth, windowHeight);
	// background placed here so we can see progression of the squares. putting background in draw would erase the squares
	// once you click your mouse.
	background(0);
	s1 = new Square();
}

function draw() {
	// keeps looping through this draw function of the square and increments that same square unless I redraw
	// by clicking the mouse press function. then the redraw square is incremented until it becomes connected 
	// to the prev square, then that square starts to increment again.
	s1.increase();
	s1.show();

}
